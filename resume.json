I can safely say that I am still yet to meet someone with a wider breadth and depth of IT and social media knowledge. Colin’s skills in programming across a host of different computer languages and ability to push the boundaries of what is already out there are only put in the shade by his ability to patiently and extremely clearly explain, in plain English, the impact IT and social media can have on all of us.     In my experience Colin is extremely capable in working with: php, HTML5, CSS, and the APIs of Twitter, Facebook, Google Maps and Foursquare and more.     Colin’s work on the #nhssm blog and chats are an example of what he is capable of in his spare time. His work on the St George’s NHS Trust annual report (see: http://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/annual/default.asp) is groundbreaking and has raised the bar for all NHS Trusts across the UK.",
